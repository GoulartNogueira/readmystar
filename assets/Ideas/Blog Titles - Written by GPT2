For thousands of years, our ancestors looked at the stars to learn more about themselves. But in the last decades our thirst for easy and instant responses resulted in serious ancient astrology fading out. In it's place, emerged an ultra-simplified popular version of it, and so begun the astrology charlatanism.
The real old astrology is not an exact deteministic science, it requires us to reflect on the symbols so we can identify their meaning deep in our depths.
I invite you to recover the original essence of astrology and look far outwards at the stars to see deep inside yourself.

Original Writing: "For thousands of years, our ancestors looked at the stars to learn more about themselves. But in the last decades our thirst for prompt and instant responses has meant that serious astrology has lost ground (and credibility) to an ultra-simplified (and often charlatan) popular version. But it doesn't mean it doesn't work. Lot's of techniques we use today can't be fully explained by science and are also pseudo-science, like homeopathy, acupuncture or even financial technical analysis."

Aestheticized Writing: "For millennia, our forefathers looked to the stars for enlightenment. Yet nowadays, our insatiable hunger for instantaneous results has seen it fall into disrepute to a puerile and simplistic practice that is as bogus as a three-card trick. But it still works. Many of the techniques used today are not scientifically explicable and are thus akin to homeopathy, acupressure or even financial technical analysis."
