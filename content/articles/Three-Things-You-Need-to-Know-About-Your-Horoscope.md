# Three Things You Need to Know About Your Horoscope
---
Have you been reading your horoscope everyday? Have you been feeling like it doesn't describe you at all? Well, you are not alone. Most of us have felt that way at one point or another. But horoscopes can actually be very accurate if you know what to look for.

## 1 You are not defined by your Zodiac sign.
The popular horoscope, is limited to the Sun sign and therefore is over-simplified. If you have a [fire sign](/articles/fire-signs) (*[Aries](/articles//sign-aries), [Leo](/articles//sign-leo) or [Sagittarius](sign-sagittarius)*) you may believe you are adventurous and energetic, when in fact you can be quiet and reserved.
On the other hand, a [water sign](/water-signs) (*[Cancer](/sign-cancer), [Scorpio](/sign-scorpio) or [Pisces](/sign-pisces)*) may believe they are calm and patient, when in fact they can be moody and impatient.
The Solar horoscope only gives a short description of your character. To have a deeper understanding, you should learn more about the [planets](/how-the-planets-affect-your-life), [houses](/what-are-astrology-houses-anyways) and [aspects](/aspects-and-the-universal-geometry).

## 2.Your horoscope is not set in stone.
Your horoscope is a guide to what you are capable of achieving in life. It is not a pre-destined path that you cannot escape. Your horoscope simply gives you an idea of what you should focus on and where you could find fulfillment.
 If you do not like what the horoscope says, you can change your destiny by simply changing your attitude and approach to life.
Everyone has free will. You have the ability to act in a way that is completely counter to your horoscope. Your horoscope is only a general guideline of your potentials and inclinations.

The planets and stars will never force you to do anything. They simply give you an indication of what to expect and what is possible.
You are ultimately in control of your own life. You have the power to defy fate and create your own destiny.

Your horoscope is a map that you can follow or ignore. You can live your life in a way that is completely in harmony with the stars and planets. Or you can go in direct opposition to the cosmic influences of the universe.
It's all up to you.

And now the third and more important topic you should know about your horoscope:


## 3.Your horoscope is a reflection of your inner self.
Your horoscope should make you look inside yourself and answer some questions, like:
- What are my goals?
- What motivates me to do what I do?
- How can I improve myself?
- What can I expect in the future?
- How can I improve my relationship with my family?
- How can I improve my relationship with my friends?
- How can I improve my relationship with my partner/spouse?
- What can I expect from my career?

And those answers are not in your stars. The answers are within you.

The stars act as a mirror to your inner self. If you want to change your destiny, you must change yourself.
You can change your future by changing your attitude, your approach and your goals in life.
The stars and planets will never force you to do anything. It is all you.
They are not causes. They are signals. They are signs. They are a reflection of your inner self.
**You are the cause.**

The horoscope is just a map. *A map that every wise captain should have for their voyage*, but still just a map.
It's not the ship. It's not the journey. It's not the destination.
The horoscope is a guide, but you are the master of your fate.
