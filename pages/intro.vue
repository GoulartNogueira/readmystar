    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>We teach you how to read your stars so you can write your own story.</p>
    <p>
      In a world of seven billion people, what makes your life any different
      from anyone else's? What are the characteristics that define you? Your
      personality, your traits, and your experiences all shape who you are and
      what you will become.
    </p>
    <p>
      To an extent, the planets and stars already know all of this. They know
      your past and predict your future. Your zodiac sign is a reflection of who
      you are and what is to come.
