      from anyone else's?

      What are the characteristics that define you? Your personality, your
      traits, and your experiences all shape who you are and what you will
      become.

      To an extent, the planets and stars already know all of this. They know
      your past and predict your future. Your zodiac sign is a reflection of who
      you are and what is to come.
